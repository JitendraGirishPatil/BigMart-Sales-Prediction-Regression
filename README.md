## Problem Statement
The success of any retail store depends upon its sales. In a fast paced market, it is imperative to understand trends such as fast or slow moving products, impact of store type, and more. In order to strategize their business models, store owners rely heavily on past data to predict future sales, this is where the value of regression modeling can be utilized.

Build a supervised learning regression model to predict the sales of the store.

## My Approach
Created few ML Models that include data visualisation and data preprocessing, and for model building and obtaining best performing model MSE, RMSE and r2 scores were used to determine the best model.

Linear Regression, Decision tree regressor, ensemble techniques like Random Forest Regressor and Stacking were the Supervised machine learning models used in this project. 
The best model obtained is the XGBoost Regressor.

## Technologies Used
